                <p> My name is Rowan Chad Muad'Dib Valle y Carmenatty, however I just go by Rowan because although
                    I love the traditional Hispanic naming conventions, that's too verbose, and I like mononyms.
                </p>

                <p>I joined the army at 18 and went to Iraq soon after. I was deployed in "the sandbox" for 15 months
                    where I performed patrol and QRF (quick reactionary force) duties, and also helped secure and guard
                    territory and engaged the population in "hearts and minds" missions.
                    I was in a total of 6 years including two years with the national guard.

                    Soon after I joined the guard I was in college. I pursued a degree in philosophy, but after
                    graduation,
                    I was left craving adventure again. However, the army would not do. I was by this time against
                    the idiotic miliary engagements that did nothing but waste money and lives in the service of the
                    ugliest
                    kinds of greed. I needed to travel.
                    I went to California in pursuit of a job in a permacultural farm. As chance would have it, I instead
                    began working in the cannabis industry where I spent many years doing everything from growing, to
                    brokering
                    marijuana, to making high quality hashish and developing techniques for making what me and my
                    partner in that
                    endeavor called "cold water extracts". This variety of hash contain zero solvents and is considered
                    the healthier alternative
                    to mass market hashish, which often contains solvents derived from petrochemicals.

                    The cannabis industry is fine, and today is increasing in market share, however, that's not where my
                    heart
                    is. I bought land right before the pandemic hit in 2019, and moved soon after the pandemic struck
                    North America. It's a 40 acre ranch in one of the least light polluted areas in the continental
                    United States.
                    I named it Azura. I had no plans for it other than to transform it into a beautiful oasis. Soon I
                    read that
                    people were actually making money renting out areas on their land to campers. That piqued my
                    interest and so
                    I made the requesite calls and soon had campers on my land almost daily. The milky way is the
                    greatest attraction however
                    the mountains and vast xeric landscape is something truly to be beheld.
                    Soon after all that I met my lady and we have been working to improve Azura together ever since.

                    Coding has been something I've always wanted to do but never could. My lady has coded before and she
                    actually
                    encouraged me to pursue this as a job. i tried some things here and there, learned some code and now
                    I am steadily on a journey to master computer programing and web developement. It's been such a fun
                    ride so far
                    and I am excited to continue to pursue it.
