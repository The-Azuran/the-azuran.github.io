        this image is the much beloved mr Rogers wearing a clown mask. It appears
         to be made of porcelain or some ceramic material ">

    <p> Currently I'm learning to code. It's been an amazing experience and I've only been doing it for a little under
        two months but it's already opened an amazing door into a world that so far has remained unreachable for me.
        The digital world is an amazing place once you learn to manipulate it, and once you get your first taste it's
        hard to let go. These resources are mostly free, code is open and that culture keeps growing, and most objects,
        relations and qualia can be reproduced with computation. It leave me asking the tired philosophical debate
        between
        realist and idealist. I think that maybe there is a mathematical platonic realm of which we are "merely"
        shadows, although
        I use "merely" advisedly here.
